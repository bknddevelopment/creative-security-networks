# This is a placeholder for the Open Graph image
# In production, create a 1200x630 PNG image with your branding
# You can use tools like Canva, Figma, or any image editor

# The image should include:
# - Company logo/name: Creative Security Networks

# - Contact: 1-800-SECURE
# - Visual elements related to security (cameras, shields, etc.)
# - Brand colors: #1a1a2e (dark blue) and #00d4ff (cyan accent)
